# ProfileCreator
macOS application to create configuration profiles.

# Important
Development of this project stopped a few months ago because of personal reasons.

Now I'm back and will rewrite the project in Swift for better community support and futureproofing.

I will create a new branch, called Swift, and will also open up the previously closed framework (which will also be rewritten in Swift) to allow for some more shared work.

# System Requirements
ProfileCreator requires Mac OS X 10.11 or newer.
